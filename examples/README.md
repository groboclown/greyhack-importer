# Importer Examples

This directory contains a `src` tree containing MiniScript code, mostly taken from the [MiniScript GitHub project examples](https://github.com/JoeStrout/miniscript/tree/master/MiniScript-cpp/lib).  That code is under the [MIT license](https://github.com/JoeStrout/miniscript/blob/master/LICENSE) and has its own copyright.

The `.ms` files are library files, and `.src` files are Grey Hack programs.
